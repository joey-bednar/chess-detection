# Chessboard Detection with MATLAB
A 2D image of a chessboard is input to the MATLAB program. The locations of the pieces are detected using image processing techniques and translated into FEN. The resulting position in the FEN is analysed using Stockfish, an open-source chess engine, and the optimal move is calculated. The suggested move is shown by adding an arrow to the original image.
